    <h2>Why are coins so popular?</h2>

    <p>At the time of writing over 5,000 coins listed on \"Coinmarketcap\" and the list gets longer day by day.</p>
    <p>What do you think? Why do people jump into these coins? Honestly, what is the magic of it?</p>
    <p>There are a couple of reasons, but I can list most important ones: </p>
    <p>- It seems an easy way to become a millionaire, even a billionaire.</p>
    <p>- Everyone heard about it. Crypto is the future currency, fiat is dying</p>
    <p>- Unequal distribution of wealth: there are billionaires and there are poor, starving people. The gap between rich and poor is growing. People believe fiat money distributed unevenly. Maybe crypto is people's moneyâ€” crypto can fix this uneven distribution</p>
    <p>- Governments print fiat money: it's unlimited. But cryptos are limited</p>
    <p>- It's decentralized. No one can shut it down</p>
    <p>- You own your coin. No one can take it from you</p>
    <p>- It has real value and the price will go up until it reaches the moon</p>
    <p>- Privacy</p>
    <p>- It's so cheap and fast to send money with crypto</p>
    <p>- And the list goes on...</p>

<h2>Reality is different</h2>
    <p>In fact, what was expected and what is happening now is totally different</p>
    <p>Over 90% of people hold their coins on exchanges.</p>    
    <p>They require KYC, your passport, photo, address, phone number, email, IP  address, everything... You never needed this for cash!!!</p>
    <p>There is annual 1-2% inflation on USD. Right, but at least you know your money will not go down by 50% in a day.</p>
    <p>They limit your deposits, withdrawals. They can even block you and you can lose your all money.</p>
    <p>Elon or someone sends a tweet and the price dumps or pumps 50 or 200%. Is it what everyone wanted?</p>
    <p>Despite it is decentralized, it still depends on Elon or someone else or some government. Will China ban cryptos? What will the US do?</p>
    <p>The reality is, cryptos are more regulated, offer less privacy, and increases the gap between rich and poor.</p>
    <p>It takes more time, more fee, more energy...</p>
    <p>There can be some millionaires, but 90% are losing their hard-earned cash.</p>
    <p>Crypto definitely is not people's money! Whales manipulate and earn, not the people.</p>

<h2>Why :coinName ?</h2>
    <p>We hope to change it. We truly believe that we can become people's money.</p>
    <p>We offer money back guarantee. Whatever coin you bought will be deposited on our bank account and you will be able to withdraw your funds at the price you bought in a year period</p>
    <p>It means even price drops, you will secure your money. You will have confidence and will not lose your money.</p>
    <p>Only fees will be deducted. (Deposit, withdrawal etc. fees which will be minimal)</p>
    <p>We will use centralized servers for now. It doesn't make sense to use decentralized if the cons outweigh the pros, if there is no real benefit for the people.</p>
    <p>But for the future we will be always open to new technologies and better solutions.</p>
